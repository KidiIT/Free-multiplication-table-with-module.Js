# Free multiplication table with JavaScript module
 NOTE:How to use and understand the export and import of module in javascript/multiplication table
 
 1:firstly, create a hmtl file and two js files. namely,module1 and module2 respectively on your editior
 
 2:secondly create and style your html template to be more presentable 
 
 3:then on your module1.js, give the table tag on your html an ID then get it by it elementById on your module1.js file
 
 4:the next step is almost same as setp 3, import your multiplication from module2.js
 
 5:on your module2.js is where you'll write a function that'll create a table row and columns for you.
 
 6:after which the the all,all2 and the final function which will make more impact on the table as seen on my module2.js file on my repo.
 
 7:lastly you'll create a multiplication function that will multiply xAxis, yAxis and give an 100% output.
 
 8:export default multiplication after your function and feel free to input any number of multiplication table you want to use on your module1.js file as seen on my repo eg(40,40) , (20,20) etc.
